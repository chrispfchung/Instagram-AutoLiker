# Instagram-AutoLiker
I built a script using PyAutoGui that automatically "Likes" Instagram photos.

I was interested in GUIs and came across an interesting package that allowed me to control my computer with code.

Curious to see what would happen if this worked, I was equally as stunned and fascinated when my cursor seemingly moved on its own.

Step by step I wrote several functions that allowed you to open Instagram pages from your account and automatically Like photos stopping at whatever limit you set in one "session" (A session ends when the code stops)

The instaLikeScript is flexible to change. You may customize:

How many photos to like before stopping \
Which hashtags to like \
The amount of hashtags to like in one session \
The amount of time the script will pause between likes \
Select which instagram user's page to like \
How many users to like in one session \

*Script runs double the speed without screen recording
